# NovaCore

This repository contains the HTML5 canvas game **Nova Core: Genesis**. A small Node/Jest setup is provided so that game logic can be unit tested.

## Running Tests

Install dependencies (if not already done):

```bash
npm install
```

Run the Jest test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

The tests cover extracted game modules located in `src/`.
