// Potentially other constants like default font, colors if not dynamically from CSS etc.
// For now, keeping it simple with the most obvious ones.

// It might also be useful to export an object for base player stats,
// or base enemy stats, but let's keep them in their respective modules for now
// and refactor them here if it becomes cleaner.

// Example:
// export const PLAYER_DEFAULT_HP = 100;
// export const PLAYER_DEFAULT_SPEED = 2;
// export const ENEMY_DEFAULT_SPAWN_RATE = 0.02;
